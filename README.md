# PowerESP

ESP-IDF Project for managing smart BMS'es and provide smart powerbank functionality for USB charging and powering other 5v accesoiries such as a raspberry pi.
The final result should implement a small monochrome display, a push button with rgb ring for status through i2c and maybe an i2s stream from bluetooth or network depending on the usecase(perhaps a giant portable speaker?)
