# Libraries

PowerESP uses a couple of useful libraries.
These are not shipped by default in the git repository(separate forked projects to keep licensing correct/legal). To obtain them please run the following command in the project root:
```shell
make pesetuplibs
```
This will clone the libraries from git.
